# Contributing to MagicMirror³

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

---

We have a small amount of guidelines for you to consider when contributing to this project in one way or another. You can either contribute via reporting encountered bugs or adding new features to the project.

**English language** is **mandatory** for every issue, pull request or discussion. We highly recommend [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/translate) to translate from your native language in case you're still learning or struggling with technical vocabulary.

## Contribute an idea
An idea can be both a bug report and a feature suggestion issue. To account for both cases, we provided issue templates for you to fill out. Just try to be as **precise** as possible and provide **as much information as possible** when describing the issue.

Please also make sure to always choose the correct repository to avoid confusion.

## Contribute code
Contributing code is slightly more complicated than opening an issue. However, we still try to make it as easy as possible, which is why we provided pull request templates you can use to describe the bugfix or feature implementation.

First off, please always merge your changes into `develop`.

### Naming convention
Please always use **camelCase** when naming your variables and methods.

### Testing
In order for a pull request to be accepted into the project, whe have to make sure it only does what it is intended to do. That's why we encourage you to always add unit tests to your new features in order to keep the test coverage high and prevent many bugs.

When testing software, always make sure to focus on **edge cases**. Please also integrate **exception handling** in your new code to prevent unhandled errors and crashes of the system.

### Documentation
Please always add a sufficient amount of comments to your code. We don't want you to comment every single line, but we also don't want to have huge chunks of undocumented code. 

When writing comments, always keep in mind that a good comment describes what the **goal** of the following statement or method is. Usually, there is no need to describe **what** the **statement** is doing precisely except for very complex statements. 

Also Keep in mind that you're the expert on the topic you've opened the pull request in and the reviewers have to understand it easily.
